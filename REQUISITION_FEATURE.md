## 🎯 User Workflow

### Creating a Requisition

```
1. Navigate to Requisitions → Click "New Requisition"
2. Fill in basic information:
   - Enter title
   - Select project
   - Select expense account
   - Set required date (optional)
   - Mark as urgent (optional)
   - Add description and justification
3. Add line items:
   - Click "Add Item"
   - Search for items
   - Select item from catalog
   - Adjust quantity, UoM, price
   - System warns if price varies >10%
4. Upload attachments (optional):
   - Drag files or click to browse
   - PDF, JPEG, PNG up to 5MB
5. Review grand total
6. Save draft (auto-saves every 30 seconds)
7. Submit for review (becomes read-only)
```

### Auto-Save Behavior

```
- First save: Creates draft requisition
- Auto-saves every 30 seconds if:
  - Requisition is in draft status
  - At least one line item exists
- Shows "Last saved" timestamp
- Silent saves don't show notifications
- Manual saves show success message
```

### Price Variance Warnings

```
When unit price differs >10% from preferred price:
- Row highlighted in yellow
- Warning icon shown
- Variance percentage displayed
- Summary banner at bottom
- Example: If preferred = 100,000, actual = 115,000
  → Shows "+15.0% variance"
```
